			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This study evaluates the effects of using web-based tools to improve the reading fluency of fifth graders from racial and ethnic minority groups living in a low-income, urban setting.</p>

			<h4>Background</h4>
			<UL>
				<li>Reading fluency is the ability to read accurately, with appropriate pacing, expression, and rhythm.
				</li>
				<li>Reading fluency is related to comprehension skills and to overall educational achievement.</li>
				<li>Interventions can be effective in improving reading fluency.</li>
				<li>Educational technology tools have been shown to improve aspects of reading. </li>
			</UL>

			<h4>Introduction to the Problem</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The value of reading fluency is related to other reading outcomes; including reading comprehension later in life and overall educational achievement, such as scores on state tests.</li>
				<li>Fluency combines accuracy, automaticity, and oral reading prosody, which facilitate the reader’s construction of meaning.</li>
				<li>Fluency is demonstrated during oral reading through ease of word recognition, appropriate pacing, phrasing, and intonation.</li>
				<li>Reading accuracy, rate, and prosody have been found to be positively related to reading comprehension. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Accuracy is the degree to which words are read as they are intended. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Includes the ability to blend sounds and a large sight-word vocabulary for high-frequency words.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Rate is the number of words correctly read per minute.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Rate is linked to comprehension because those who do not read quickly and accurately enough tend to have difficulty remembering what was read previously. </li>
							</ul>
						<li>Prosody is the ability to read with the proper phrasing, expression, and intonation. o	Prosody is the ability to read with the proper phrasing, expression, and intonation. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Prosody influences reading comprehension because those who can read in a way that sounds more or less like everyday speech are able to better comprehend what they are reading than those whose reading is characterized by slow or labored, word-by-word reading.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<h4>Concerns in Reading Fluency</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Students who performed poorly on a state reading test were shown to have low fluency skills.</li>
				<li>Low reading fluency levels are especially noticeable for students who are members of certain groups (e.g., ethnic/racial minority groups) compared to their peers.</li>
				<li>A gap in reading fluency proficiency exists between students from low socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds compared to their peers from higher-SES backgrounds, between white children and those from minority racial/ethnic groups and between children who are English language learners (ELLs) and those who only speak English.</li>
				<li>National reading test results show that while 55% of white fourth-graders read at grade level, only 19% of African Americans 21%, of Hispanics, and 3% of ELLs reached this mark.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Interventions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Interventions can reduce the achievement gap in reading, such as the gap between children from higher and lower SES backgrounds or children from non-minority and minority backgrounds.</li>
				<li>Effective interventions tend to provide students with sufficient opportunity to practice reading text at a level that is in line with their abilities and provide appropriate feedback.</li>
				<li>Technology tools that incorporate intervention techniques that have strong evidence of effectiveness, such as providing continuous feedback and allowing for individualized assessment can lead to gains in reading fluency.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Aims</h2>

			<h4>This Study</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>One technology tool, Fluency Tutor incorporates many of the features of effective interventions and offers supports, such as allowing teachers to listen to and mark students’ recorded reading. </li>
				<li>Fluency Tutor allows students to repeatedly read grade-level passages, to hear themselves read, to assess their own reading, and to view teacher feedback from previously read and marked passages. </li>
				<li>Fluency Tutor has some evidence of effectiveness in improving reading fluency of fifth graders from an unpublished report within a school with children who were mostly white (90%). </li>
				<li>No evidence has been collected to date on whether it can improve reading fluency of younger students from low SES and diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds.</li>
				<li>The current study focuses on low-income children in fifth grade from minority racial/ethnic groups living in an urban setting.</li>
				<li>The study involves a randomized experiment of the impacts of an intervention using Fluency Tutor on the reading skills of fifth graders, most of whom were behind grade-level in reading (72%). </li>
				<li>The instructional objective of the treatment group is for students to use the technology at regular intervals to repeatedly practice reading ability-appropriate texts orally, with feedback from the technology and from the teacher, such that all students are at grade level or above in reading fluency.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Research Questions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The research questions guiding this study are as follows:</li>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>What are the impacts of Fluency Tutor on the reading fluency of fifth graders representing racial and ethnic minority groups from low-resource communities?</li>
					<li>Does the relationship between Fluency Tutor use and student outcomes vary depending on intervention dosage (i.e., how many minutes students used the technology)?</li>
				</ol>
				<li>I expect to find positive impacts of the treatment for students who use the program as intended. </li>
				<li>For these students, I hypothesize that students in the treatment group will outperform those in the control group on fluency posttests given immediately following the intervention, and on standardized tests given at the end of the school year.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Methods</h2>

			<h4>Design</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The pretest, intervention, and posttest design involved research-administered assessments and collection of teacher- and state-administered test scores.</li>
				<li>Three classrooms of fifth-grade students were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. </li>
				<li>Fluency Tutor logins were only provided for children in treatment groups. </li>
				<li>Students who were assigned to the treatment group used the Fluency Tutor program during this time, while students assigned to the control group delivered reading instruction as they normally would without Fluency Tutor.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Participants</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The study included 90 fifth grade students whose parents returned consent forms in a classroom of a school in an urban public school district in the northeast United States. </li>
				<li>Most of the students (72%) in all classrooms were behind grade-level in reading as determined by the fall Developmental Reading Assessment 2nd Edition (DRA-2: Beaver and Carter, 2006) scores. </li>
				<li>The mean age of the sample was 105 months (SD = 5.9). Of the original 90 students in the sample, four were excluded due to having Individualized Educational Plans, or IEPs (which means that they have been identified as having special needs). The remaining 90 students completed posttests. </li>
				<li>There was no difference between treatment and control groups on any of the pretest scores. Demographic characteristics and assessment descriptive for children by group can be found in Table 1.</li>
				<li>The students were comparable across treatment and control groups in terms of the literacy environment, as found on the Early Language and Literacy Classroom Observation (ELLCO K-5). </li>
				<li>Total mean scores across all 18 indicators were 2.6 for control and 2.8 for treatment classrooms. See Measures below for more information on the ELLCO K-5.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Materials</h2>
			<h4>Interventions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>All students received reading instruction during the intervention period (e.g., small group book reading with teacher). </li>
				<li>Children in the treatment groups used the Fluency Tutor program for an average of 30 min per week for the 12 weeks of the intervention between February and April, and control teachers taught as they normally would. </li>
				<li>One control group used mobymax.com and the other used https://readingeggs.com/.</li>
					
					<h6>MobyMax</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>The Mobymax reading skills literature module for grades K-8 builds reading skills by asking students to read and answer questions about what they read to test comprehension. </li>
						<li>Students can hear the passages read by a computerized voice but they cannot record themselves reading out loud and play it back. </li>
					</ul>

					<h6>Readingeggs</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>Readingeggs is a reading program developed for 3- to 7-year-olds who are learning to read. </li>
						<li>The website offers 120 lessons which cover the basics of learning to read such as letter sounds, phonics, and high-frequency sight words. </li>
						<li>There is less emphasis on reading comprehension or practice increasing reading speed in this pro-gram compared to Fluency Tutor. </li>

				</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Fluency Tutor is an online, interactive tool with over 400 fiction and non-fiction passages of varying text difficulty. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Major components of the program are modeled on best practice, such as: </li>
							<ol type="1">
								<li>Having students read ability-level passages aloud.</li>
								<li>Having students read passages multiple times.</li>
								<li>Providing feedback during or after reading by a knowledgeable adult.</li>
							</ol>
					</ul>
				<li>To use Fluency Tutor, teachers assign passages, and students access the passages at a computer connected to the internet while wearing headsets. </li>
				<li>Program components include:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Practice My Reading</li>
						<li>Measure My Reading</li>
						<li>How Did I Do?</li>
						<li>See My Progress</li>
					</ol>
					
						<li>During Practice My Reading</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Students read a passage silently, hear assigned passages read to them, read assigned passages out loud into a microphone, respond to reading comprehension questions, and play back their own voice reading the passage. </li>
							<li>Students can also view their reading speed and their performance on the reading comprehension questions.</li>
							<li>They can go back and reread the passage and retake the reading comprehension quiz as many times as they like. </li>
							<li>The program automatically keeps track of total minutes of practice time.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>During Measure My Reading</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Allows teachers to assign passages that also serve as assessments. </li>
							<li>This mode functions similarly to the practice sessions, except that students cannot hear themselves read back and they cannot retake the reading comprehension questions. </li>
							<li>The program automatically records their reading time and their voices reading the passage. </li>
							<li>Teachers later login to the management system to listen to the first minute of each passage, flag errors, and rate prosody. </li>
							<li>The format of the Measure My Reading assessment aligns closely with recommendations of ongoing Curriculum-Based Measurement (see more details about Measure My Reading below under Measures).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>During How Did I Do?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Students later login to view the scored assessment passages.</li>
							<li>Here students can listen to themselves read, see the corrections and notes made by the teacher, and see their reading comprehension and prosody scores. </li>
						</ul>
						<li>See My Progress</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Students can see charts and graphs illustrating how their reading has developed over time.</li>
						</ul>
			</ul>
			<h4>Measures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I obtained data on student demographics and student reading skill.</li>
				<li>Demographic data collected from the schools include gender, race/ethnicity, free or reduced school lunch (FRSL) status, and English as a second language (ESL) status. </li>
				<li>The remaining assessments are described below.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Measure My Reading (MMR). Fluency Tutor’s MMR component, as described above, was also used as an outcome measure for this study. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>The tool evaluates multiple aspects of students’ reading fluency: words correct per minute (WCPM), accuracy (percent of words correctly read in 1 min: WCPC), prosody,1 and comprehension. </li>
							<li>I identified four passages within the system to use for the evaluations that were explicitly excluded for use during the intervention. Thus, all passages were new to all students in the study. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>These passages ranged in difficulty above and below the 50% level for fifth grade (Lexile levels between 830 L and 1010 L).  </li>
								<li>The reading level of the passages was as follows: </li>
								<ul>
									<li>Help! I’m Trapped in My Teacher’s Body, Lexile level: 600L, word count: 50</li>
									<li>The Indian in the Cupboard, Lexile level 780L, word count 80</li>
									<li>The Secret Garden, Lexile level: 970L, word count: 148 </li>
									<li>The Pushcart War, Lexile level: 1050L, word count: 239</li>
								</ul>
								<li>All students read all passages. </li>
							</ul>
							<li>Orally-read passages and responses to reading comprehension passages were recorded and scored. </li>
							<li>Total time required to complete the assessment tasks on the MMR varied from approximately 8 to 15 min.</li>
							<li>The first minute of reading was scored for errors, such as skipped or mispronounced words. </li>
								<ul>
									<li>Based on the errors identified and the 1-min mark, the program automatically calculated the WCPM and WCPC. </li>
								</ul>
							<li>The student was rated on oral reading for prosody on expression, smoothness, phrasing, and pace using a 4-point scale. </li>
							<li>Scores were averaged across passages to result in one score for each subscale: WCPM, WCPC, comprehension (total correct out of four multiple-choice questions), and prosody (average score on the four components). </li>
								<ul>
									<li>I created z-scores for each subscale using the mean and standard deviation of all scores across both time points (pre- and posttest), so that no one subscale would be weighted more heavily than another. </li>
									<li>The z-scores were then averaged across the four components within each time point, resulting in one mean MMR composite z-score for pre- and one for posttest.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Reliability was calculated using single intra-class correlation (ICC) as there was one primary expert rater.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>ICCs were .86, .97, and .64 for the three major rated subscales respectively: prosody, words correct per minute, and percent of words correctly read. </li>
								</ul>
							<li>Reliability was calculated using single intra-class correlation (ICC) as there was one primary expert rater.</li>
								<ul>
									<ul>ICCs were .86, .97, and .64 for the three major rated subscales respectively: prosody, words correct per minute, and percent of words correctly read. </ul>
								</ul>
							<li>The fourth major subscale score for comprehension was automatically calculated by the computer based on students’ responses to multiple choice reading comprehension questions, and therefore has no subjectivity in scoring. </li>
							<li>The present study found strong correlations between the MMR total score and the The Gray Oral Reading Test (see below) total score (r = .809 for pretests).</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>The Gray Oral Reading Test-5th Edition (GORT-5: Wiederhold and Bryant 2012). The GORT-5 is a standardized reading fluency screening test. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>This assessment includes reading rate, reading accuracy, and comprehension.</li>
							<li>Students individually read passages aloud while a trained assessor times the student and marks mispronounced or missing words. </li>
							<li>When the students have completed reading a passage, the assessor removes the passage booklet and asks the students related comprehension questions. </li>
							<li>A stop rule applies when students reach a set amount of errors. </li>
							<li>Significant reliability and validity data have been collected on this instrument, and it is widely used. The test manual cites average criterion validity ranging from .68 to .77, and test–retest reliability ranged from .82 to .90. </li>
							<li>The GORT-5 provides scaled scores that can also be totaled. </li>
							<li>The final totaled sum of scaled scores was used in the analyses.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>The Developmental Reading Assessment—2nd Edition (DRA-2: Beaver and Carter 2006). </li>
					<ul>
						<li>The DRA-2 was administered to the students in the fall and spring. </li>
						<li>The DRA-2 is an individually-administered reading assessment for student reading level based on accuracy, fluency, and comprehension. </li>
						<li>Assessment tasks include a student reading survey and a set of leveled paperback books, each including a teacher observation guide and student booklet. </li>
						<li>The test–retest reliability ranged from .92 to .99 for grades 3-5, and internal consistency was .97</li>
						<li>Correlations between DRA independent reading level and grade equivalents for the Comprehension subtest on the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) were between .54 and .84</li>
						<li>The score needed to be identified as meeting grade-level proficiency at the beginning of 5th grade is 28, while the score that represents meeting grade-level proficiency at the end of 5th grade is 38. </li>
						<li>Overall scores were used in the fall and spring in our analyses.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>MAP stands for Missouri Assessment Program. It is a series of assessments for English language arts, mathematics and science at grades 3-8; and English language arts, mathematics, science and social studies in high school. These assessments are designed to check student learning to find out if Missouri students are reaching the Show-Me Standards.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The Grade-Level assessments are made up of multiple-choice and machine-scored items, as well as "constructed response" items. Constructed response items require students to supply (rather than select) an appropriate response.</li>
						<li>Grade Level:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>MAP exam for fifth grade given by the state assesses reading comprehension and writing. </li>
								<li>Total scores include points for both writing and reading comprehension together, and are reported as scale scores, with the following levels applying: Advanced Proficient 250–300, Proficient 200–249, Partially Proficient 100–199. Scores are criterion-referenced and therefore take into account the test-taker’s grade, not age. </li>
								<li>The assessment was subjected to substantial and rigorous test development and has exhibited strong evidence of reliability and validity.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>

				<li>The Early Language and Literacy Classroom Observation (ELLCO K-5) is a classroom quality observation instrument aimed at identifying quality of literacy and language practices in K-5 classrooms. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Scores on 18 indicators are totaled to create five main component scores, including classroom structure, curriculum, language environment, books and reading, and print and writing. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Score for each indicator are between 1 and 5 as follows: </li>
									<ul>
										<li>1-deficient (minimal evidence)</li>
										<li>2-inadequate (limited evidence)</li>
										<li>3-basic (some evidence)</li>
										<li>4-strong (sufficient evidence)</li>
										<li>5-exemplary (compelling evidence)</li>
									</ul>
								<li>The purpose of this tool, which was administered and was to compare the quality of the literacy environment across the groups.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<h4>Procedure</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I was given prior training that covered test procedures and required me to conduct a practice session according to administration rules without errors before being approved for testing. </li>
					<li>The assessments were administered in accordance with the guidelines in the instructional manuals. </li>
					<li>Pretesting occurred over a 3-week period prior to the intervention in January, with 79% of GORT-5 and MMR data collected within 2 weeks. </li>
					<li>Active parental consent was obtained, and verbal assent was obtained from all students before testing began.</li>
					<li>Classrooms were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. </li>
					<li>I was trained on how to assign passages, how to determine when passages of varying difficulty levels can be assigned, how to score and code student readings, among other functions. </li>
					<li>The DRA-2 tests were administered as a part of their annual school testing. </li>
					<li>Similarly, end of the year fifth grade MAP ELA exams were given as usual by the school district, and scores from the participating students were provided for my analyses.</li>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Treatment groups and racial/ethnic groups were compared at pretest to evaluate equivalence at pretest. </li>
				<li>There were no significant differences between treatment and control or between racial/ethnic groups at pretest. </li>
				<li>Regression models with variance–covariance matrix of the estimators was adjustment for clustering at the classroom level were used to estimate the impact of treatment groups on child outcomes. </li>
				<li>SES was not included in final models because most of the sample (64%) qualified for FRSL. </li>
				<li>A Holm-Bonferroni Sequential Correction was applied to account for having four outcomes.</li>
				<li>Effect sizes are provided because they have been reported in the literature as increasingly more important than p-values. </li>

			<h2>Reading Fluency</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>For research question 1, I compared posttest or end-of-the-year scores for the treatment and control groups on the MMR, GORT-5, the DRA-2, and the MAP-ELA.</li>
					<li>The treatment group outperformed the control group on  the MMR (d = .330). </li>
					<li>Comparisons revealed no difference between treatment and control on the spring DRA-2 text reading level. </li>
					<li>The ELA exam is half reading comprehension and half writing. </li>
					<li>The pretest MMR comprehension score was chosen as the pretest covariate because it highly correlated (r = .696) with the ELA exam score. </li>
					<li>To further explore these findings, I compared the scores on the assessments given by the research, the MMR, and the GORT-5. </li>
					<li>These scores were strongly correlated with one another (r between .78 and .84). They were also strongly correlated with the other reading measures given by the teachers and state (see Table 3). </li>
					<li>Differences in instrumentation may have played a role in lack of effect in the analyses, at least for the GORT-5. </li>
					<li>The GORT-5 is a standardized tool and appeared to be much less sensitive to change. </li>
					<li>Although the full sample’s raw scores on the GORT-5 increased from pre- to posttest, the scaled scores actually decreased from pretest (m = 15.6) to posttest (m = 14.0). </li>
					<li>There was more variation in scores on the other two assessments, the DRA-2 and the MMR, and scores on both increased significantly from pre- to posttest for the whole sample.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Amount of Technology Use</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>To answer research question 2, I evaluated whether or not the amount of program use in the treatment group was related to outcomes. </li>
					<li>Note that these analyses are outside of the randomized design, and are therefore exploratory. </li>
					<li>Correlations between assessment scores and time on task were included (Table 3). </li>
					<li>Note that the correlations are stronger between time using Fluency Tutor and posttest than they are between time using Fluency Tutor and pretest for all measures. </li>
					<li>This suggests a possible relationship between dosage and test score gain.</li>
					<li>The average amount of Fluency Tutor usage (M = 5.9 h) was not related to age, but was related to gain on DRA-2 score, (r = .385, p = .0012: treatment group only). </li>
					<li>Amount of Fluency Tutor use was not correlated with gain in scores on the other measures. </li>
					<li>To further explore dosage, I recoded the treatment group into those students who used the program for more (high-use) and less (low-use) time than the median split of total number of hours of program use. </li>
					<li>The high-use treatment group consisted of 30 children, 18 females and 12 males. Eighteen were identified by their schools as Hispanic and 12 as Black, and all classrooms included children in both groups, except for one. </li>
					<li>There was no significant difference between low-use and high-use children on any of the four pretest scores, but there were more students reading at grade level in the fall in high-use group (52%) than in the control groups (23%) or the low-use group (16%).</li>
					<li>I analyzed the impacts of the treatment using the high-use treatment students only compared to the control students on all outcomes. </li>
					<li>High-use treatment students out performed control students on the MMR (d = .296; p = .010) and MAP-ELA scores (d = .473; p = .006). </li>
					<li>The mean MAP-ELA score was 195 (19.9) for the high-use group 179 (19.3) for the control group, and 176 (22.8) for the low-use group. </li>
					<li>The low-use group’s growth in DRA-2 scores was significantly less (mean gain = 5.2) from fall to spring than the control group’s growth (mean gain = 7.2; p = .023; d = .246) or the high-use group’s growth (mean gain = 8.3; p = .011; d = .378). </li>
					<li>There remained no differences on the GORT-5. </li>

					<li>High-use students who were not reading at grade level in the fall were more likely to read at grade level by the end of the year compared to students in either the control or low use groups. </li>
					<li>Of those students who were not yet meeting instructional reading level in the fall of 5th grade; 7% of the control group, 0% of low-use treatment group, and 20% of the high-use treatment group moved up to reading at grade-level or higher by spring. </li>
					<li>There was no correlation in the full sample between fall DRA-2 scores and gain in DRA-2 scores from fall to spring (r = − .006, p = .95).</li>

			<h2>Discussions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Reading fluency is an important indicator of other success markers for reading, including comprehension and state English language arts assessment scores.</li>
				<li>Technology tools have promise for raising the level of reading fluency, but more research is needed on their effects, especially with students who may start school behind their peers. </li>
				<li>This study evaluated the impacts of using a reading fluency technology tool on the reading fluency and other related outcomes of fifth-graders’ from low-SES and minority ethnic/racial backgrounds, compared to business-as-usual control group. </li>
				<li>I hypothesized that students who used this reading fluency program would outperform students in the control group on immediate reading fluency outcomes and on delayed tests of reading skill.</li>
				<li>Fifth graders from low-resource communities who used the reading fluency program Fluency Tutor were compared to those who did not use it. </li>
				<li>The control group students also had scheduled online reading time with other programs, but this project did not measure, control, or evaluate this use. </li>
				<li>Students who used Fluency Tutor outperformed students in the control group on reading fluency as measured by the MMR tool. </li>
				<li>Effect sizes were of educationally important size considering the group of the children at d = .33. Bloom et al. (2007) found the average effect size representing change in reading scores from fifth to sixth grade to be .36. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>The effect sizes reported here are over and above that. </li>
						<li>This confirms my hypothesis.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>The findings on the GORT-5 were not in line with the hypothesis. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Although the scores from GORT-5 correlated with the scores on the MMR, no differences in reading fluency assessment were found on the GORT-5. </li>
						<li>Correlations between these two instruments ranged from .79 on the posttest scores to .81 on the pretest scores. </li>
						<li>One reason for this difference in effects is that the GORT scores were much less sensitive to change over time than the other measures.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>The amount of program use within the treatment group may have mattered. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Students in the high-use group (those who used the program for more than the median number of hours) scored higher on the end of the year ELA state tests and on the MMR than did the control students. </li>
						<li>Although I cannot infer causation, this is suggestive and may be evidence to support a further study in which participants are randomly assigned to use the tool for varying amounts of time. </li>
						<li>In addition, students who were not reading at grade level in the fall in the high-use treatment group were more likely to reach grade-level in reading by the spring than those in either the low-use treatment or the control group. </li>
						<li>This supports research that has found a link between reading fluency and scores on the ELA tests.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>This study also found that students who were in the treatment group but used the tool for less time, (i.e., those in the low-use group) may have actually suffered compared to the control group. </li>
				<li>This is evidenced in differences in scores between low-use students and control group students on school-administered reading level tests. </li>
				<li>It is also supported by the fact that only 10% of this group reached grade-level in reading, compared to 25% in the control group and 56% in the high-use group. </li>
				<li>This may have been due to loss of instructional time while children waited for technology issues to be resolved (e.g., district laptops locking children out when they forgot their passwords). </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Limitations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The sample involved in this study was small. </li>
				<li>In addition, a note of caution must be made with respect to interpreting the results involving low- and high-use treatment groups. </li>
				<li>I cannot say that these impacts were caused by the treatment because students were not randomly assigned to the high-use group. </li>
				<li>I can say that there was a positive relationship between amount of program use and outcomes on some measures compared to control group children. </li>
				<li>It is also notable that there was no correlation between fall reading levels (DRA-2) and gain in reading levels from fall to spring in the full sample. </li>
				<li>The fact that high-use students started out with higher reading levels than low-use students, and that distribution of children in these groups was not equal across classrooms, could mean that they were different in other ways that I did not measure (e.g., motivation). </li>
				<li>Another limitation was that the format of the MMR assessment that was used during the intervention.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The specific passages were not used by the intervention group, and I ensured that all students understood the assessment instructions, so prior experience is unlikely to have influenced scores significantly. </li>
						<li>It remains possible that some familiarity with the format could have influenced results. </li>
						<li>Future research should include additional fluency assessments that are not integrated with the program but that are sensitive to change due to intervention. </li>
					</ul>
				<li>Another limitation is that the distribution of the ethnic and racial subgroups was imbalanced across the treatment and control groups. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Although this study evaluated the group of students as a whole, future research might look at a sample that includes larger numbers of children who represent each group in order to evaluate whether the software was more effective for certain subgroups of children than others. </li>
					</ul>
				<li>The amount of hours of software use was also less than expected. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Students need many hours of practice and exposure to text to improve their reading skills significantly. </li>
						<li>Although the available resources limited the duration of this intervention, future evaluations should include higher intervention dosages. </li>

			<h2>Recommendations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Although the available resources limited the duration of this intervention, future evaluations should include higher intervention dosages. </li>
				<li>They must be woven into a reading program in which teachers provide mediation and the requisite ongoing feedback. </li>
				<li>Such tools hold promise for increasing effectiveness, efficiency, and appeal of reading instruction through use of online, media-based reading fluency programs. </li>
				<li>Challenges of implementation in the real world can limit the extent to which these products and features can lead to changes in reading fluency. </li>
				<li>Regarding effectiveness, evidence here suggests that using programs like Fluency Tutor as intended, with features such as repeatedly reading the same text out loud, listening to recorded passages, and getting specific feedback from educators can lead to some changes in important reading skills. </li>
				<li>Although modest, the gains found in this study are notable considering that students in the control group were also using web-based reading programs for a similar amount of time (even if specifics of number of minutes and ways they were used are not available). </li>
				<li>The program may allow students who are not comfortable reading aloud in front of peers to practice oral reading, listen to themselves read, and receive teacher feedback in a safe, personalized environment. </li>
				<li>In one case, a student who was otherwise very shy and self-conscious about his low reading skills became outspoken and confident about his oral reading ability after using the tool.</li>
				<li>At the same time, effectiveness was severely limited and perhaps even detrimental for students who could not get onto the program regularly at their defined times, due to technology issues. </li>
				<li>Future research is needed to fully understand effectiveness of these types of educational technology online tools for reading with larger samples that can delve more deeply into questions related to for whom are these tools effective and under what circumstances. </li>
				<li>Educational technology tools such as Fluency Tutor may increase efficiency, as teachers can focus their teaching on a smaller group of students while others interact independently with the technology. </li>
				<li>In this study, when Fluency Tutor was made a part of the total ELA curriculum (approximately 25 min per week), students showed significant growth in fluency. </li>
				<li>Students did not need to spend their entire language arts instructional time on reading fluency.</li>
				<li>That leaves time for teachers to provide instruction related to vocabulary, comprehension, and writing, all of which are essential to children’s overall development as readers and writers. </li>
				<li>The efficiency of the instructional strategies used by the program are severely limited in the face of practical issues that limit exposure or practice from the technology or from the teacher during the scheduled time. </li>
				<li>The efficiency of the instructional strategies used by the program are severely limited in the face of practical issues that limit exposure or practice from the technology or from the teacher during the scheduled time. </li>
				<li>Appeal of an educational technology program is important as this can influence whether or not or the extent to which people engage with an innovation. </li>
				<li>Based on the limited anecdotal evidence in this study, in general, both student and teacher found the technology appealing. </li>
				<li>Most students were interacting with the program and enjoyed hearing their recorded voices.</li>
				<li>On the other hand, there were also students who were less enthusiastic about the reading activities involved, and required additional encouragement to complete the assignments. </li>
				<li>As in most classrooms, there is a range of levels of interest in reading (or most any) tasks across students, and I expect that using technology as a mode of delivery and feedback is more appealing than traditional modalities because of the interactive media interface. I could not answer that question in the current study.</li>
				<li>Increasingly, elementary school classrooms include educational technology tools to support reading and reading fluency, as was the case in the control group classrooms in this study.</li>
				<li>Research that evaluates specific tools may assist educators in making informed decisions about those tools and those instructional strategies and features that are most effective for their particular context. </li>
				<li>Teachers can support students’ independent reading fluency practice with such tools while freeing resources to work with other groups of students during these times. </li>
				<li>At the same time, I must address the technological challenges of using these types of tools whose effectiveness depends on reliable and functional technological resources and supports in schools. </li>
